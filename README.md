## Got it — you want a **README.md** file for your GitHub repository.
I’ll read your `task 4.ipynb` notebook and create a ready-to-use README that describes the project, usage, and requirements.

Let’s do this step-by-step:

1. I’ll check what’s inside the notebook to understand its purpose.
2. I’ll then generate a **professional and clean README.md** for GitHub.


Your notebook doesn’t have any markdown descriptions — it only contains code.
I’ll need to skim that code to understand what the project does so I can create a meaningful README.md for your GitHub repo.


Your notebook is a **Spam Detection project** using the **Naive Bayes classifier** on an SMS dataset.
I can now create a **README.md** file for your GitHub repository that explains:

* Project Overview
* Installation
* Usage
* Dataset info
* Output examples

Here’s your generated README.md:

---

```markdown
# 📩 SMS Spam Detection using Naive Bayes

This project implements an **SMS Spam Classifier** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm.  
It classifies SMS messages as either **Ham (Not Spam)** or **Spam** based on the message content.

---

## 📌 Features
- Loads and preprocesses an SMS dataset.
- Converts text messages into numerical vectors using **CountVectorizer**.
- Trains a **Naive Bayes** model.
- Evaluates model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Displays a **Confusion Matrix** heatmap.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is from:
```

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pycon-2016-tutorial/master/data/sms.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pycon-2016-tutorial/master/data/sms.tsv)

````
- **Columns**: `label` (spam/ham), `message` (text of the SMS)

---

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "task 4.ipynb"
```

Or run as a Python script:

```bash
python task4.py
```

---

## 📊 Output Example

* **Accuracy Score:** \~98%
* **Confusion Matrix:**

```
[[965   0]
 [ 19 130]]
```

---

## 📜 License

This project is licensed under the MIT License.

Do you want me to also create a **requirements.txt** file for your repo so everything installs easily? That would make your GitHub project plug-and-play.
```
